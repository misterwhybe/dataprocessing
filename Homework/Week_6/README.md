Welcome to the readme of this linked view!
If you move with your mouse over the countries, you will see the name of the country and the adjusted net household income.
The countries which are green contain data, and the countries which are black do not.
The level of green explains the height of the adjusted net household income. 
If you click a green country, a bar chart will open.
Here you can see the life expectancy and the years a person has education, on average.
